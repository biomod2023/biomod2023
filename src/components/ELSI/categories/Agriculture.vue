        <p>
            Biofilms can have beneficial uses in some cases, such as how the food industry uses them for water and wastewater treatment, plant health enhancement, and food product productivity (Olanbiwoninu & Popoola, 2022).
            As a result, it would be detrimental to the food industry and those who work in it if enzymosomes carrying biofilm degrading enzymes were to come in contact with these biofilms.
            This could impact the livelihoods of farmers and landowners, as well as the supply of food available to the larger population.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-subtitle-sm lg:text-subtitle mt-4">Potential Non-Researcher Response</h2>
        <p>
            Any impact on the food industry could cause the general public to view this product in a negative light, resulting in wariness and resistance against its use.
            Because this affects an industry essential to survival, this is more likely to elicit a negative response.

            <b>Rebuttal:</b> It is not difficult to ensure that the production and use of enzymosomes remains far from key biofilms of the food industry.
            A protocol for enzymosome “spills” or “leaks” can also be developed to minimize the impact of any enzymosomes on these biofilms.
