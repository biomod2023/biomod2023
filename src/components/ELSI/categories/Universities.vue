        <p>
            In order to create enzymosomes, universities and research facilities must obtain materials from various sources, which are usually chemical suppliers.
            Some of these suppliers may obtain these materials in a way that is considered unethical, such as through harming humans or other organisms.
            Alternatively, the company itself may support unethical practices, meaning that purchasing their products would be  indirectly supporting these practices. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-subtitle-sm lg:text-subtitle mt-4">Potential Non-Researcher Response</h2>
        <p>
            People dislike supporting unethically produced innovations, which may lead to backlash regardless of how beneficial the technology could be.
            This may lead to boycotts and wariness of the product, lessening its positive impact.

            <b>Rebuttal:</b> A background check on material sources and suppliers can be easily performed to ensure that any materials used are ethically sound.
