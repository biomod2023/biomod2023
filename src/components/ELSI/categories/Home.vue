        <p>
            One possible application of the enzymosome is in healthcare to treat biofilms in patients, such as those with cystic fibrosis.
            With the development of a new treatment, it is natural that the general public–both those receiving treatment and not–may have concerns about the possible short-term and long-term risks the project may pose,
            and how safe it is for everyone that may directly or indirectly come in contact with it.
            Particularly since our enzyme has a very general target of DNA, which is present everywhere and not just in affected patients, even individuals or things not intended to receive the treatment may also be affected.
            So, it is necessary to consider how we can mitigate possible risks, and all possible groups that could be affected.

        <h2 class="text-subtitle-sm lg:text-subtitle mt-4">Potential Non-Researcher Response</h2>
        <p>
            Patients could be worried about the risks of receiving a treatment involving our project and whether there are risks for individuals around them as well.
            This apprehension could discourage individuals affected by cystic fibrosis from receiving treatment due to the potential risks outweighing the benefits, and other members of the general public
            may disapprove if they are worried they themselves may be affected by secondhand effects.

        <p>
            <b>Rebuttal:</b> To mitigate concerns, we could regularly monitor patients after they have received treatment to see if any of the common symptoms of cystic fibrosis worsen (ie. severe cough, lung infections, etc.) during trials to ensure the safety of our product.
            The monitoring would need to occur over a long period of time to also study possible long-term effects of treatment. We should also take care to monitor the effects on individuals in regular contact with patients (ie. family, friends, staff administering treatment, etc.)
            to ensure there is no negative effect on them as well. Additionally, experimentation for how our enzymosomes perform in the presence of other non-target DNA to imitate how it functions in non-controlled conditions could be attempted to develop an idea of how our project
            may indirectly affect the environment. If any side effects posing significant health concerns do arise, we would have to develop a treatment plan for patients and those around them before continuing to test or distribute our enzymosomes.
