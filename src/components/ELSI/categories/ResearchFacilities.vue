        <p>
            The concern with research facilities will be the impact of the waste products both on the people working with the enzymosomes in research facilities and for the environment as well.
            The waste products that are produced must be monitored for potential health impacts on researchers as well as harmful effects they could have during disposal both to the facility and to the environment. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-subtitle-sm lg:text-subtitle mt-4">Potential Non-Researcher Response</h2>
        <p>
            There may be reluctance for labs in general to take on projects relating to enzymosomes if there are huge concerns for ethical implications of the product as a whole and on the environment.
            If these concerns are made public then it would have an impact on the users of the product as well as they will be more reluctant to use a product that is ethically ambiguous.
