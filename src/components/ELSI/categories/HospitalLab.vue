        <p>
            As we prepare treatment for testing, it raises questions focused on the ethics of who should receive initial trials and treatment involving our enzymosomes.
            Should we try to make it useful for as many people as possible or focus on treating certain demographics more effectively? If we are targeting certain groups, who and why?
            What groups are disadvantaged during testing stages? 
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-subtitle-sm lg:text-subtitle mt-4">Potential Non-Reseracher Response</h2>
        <p>
            Patients may be dissatisfied that some people are able to receive the test treatments and benefit first, and become frustrated with us and our research. There could also be negative reactions from regions that would struggle to receive treatment,
            either they are too rural to be regularly monitored or low income and lack the necessary equipment.

            <b>Rebuttal:</b> If we have to target certain demographics due to cost restraints for example, we can base our target demographic on the groups of people and regions most affected by bacterial biofilms.
            This would allow us to immediately distribute our treatment to and assist as many people as possible who are the most impacted. This would also have the additional benefit of allowing us to conduct more trials and collect data studying the effectiveness of treatment.
            We should also consider the ability of the community to benefit from treatment when considering which demographic to target for trials, so we should research whether there are certain demographics that are better suited for receiving initial trial stages of treatment,
            or if there are others that are at a higher risk and more susceptible to being affected by negative side effects.
            To combat the possibility of certain demographics perhaps being unable to receive the treatment we can also try to reach out to rural communities or low-income regions that are likely to have more difficulties accessing the treatment but would greatly benefit
            (due to how long hospital stays and cost of treatment currently are for cystic fibrosis treatments). Also, during testing, we can still try to run trials on members of other groups outside our target demographic to see what adjustments should be made to ensure a diverse range of people can benefit,
            and if any risks do arise we can investigate if all demographics are equally affected.
