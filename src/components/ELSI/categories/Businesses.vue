        <p>
            Because there is potential for this project to be commercialized and it is based on a combination of pre-existing concepts, there is a concern over whether doing so will violate any intellectual property over the concepts involved.
            Intellectual property is important because it helps to ensure that those involved in creating these concepts receive the credit for and benefits of their efforts.
            Thus, it is important that any intellectual property involved is respected when commercializing any application of these concepts.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-subtitle-sm lg:text-subtitle mt-4">Potential Non-Researcher Response</h2>
        <p>
            If existing intellectual property is not properly respected, the resulting commercial product may face public backlash in addition to legal and ethical issues,
            as it would be seen as trying to unfairly profit from the work of others.
